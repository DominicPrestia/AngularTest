# AngularTest
This was a challenge given to me to create a car, truck, boat and rental site that was optimized for desktop and mobile. 

The Specifications are as follows: 

Introduction
The intention of this coding test is to assess your ability to work with requirements commonly seen at -----------. We want you to display your knowledge of software design patterns, the AngularJS framework, HTML-CSS-Javascript best practices, and responsive web. This is NOT an evaluation of matching a creative comp document. Style as much or as little as you would like, the aesthetic design is not under consideration in this exercise.
Your AngularJS (1.x) web application will be an inventory viewer. The site will show the inventory of a business; their inventory consists of boats, cars, and trucks. The user will be able to view inventory and reserve a vehicle.
Requirements
1.	Asynchronously load the JSON inventory feeds:
2.	Run each boat, car, and truck entry through its respective constructor or decorator.
3.	List all collections in the "Vehicle List" view
  a.	Optional: Stagger-animate the list population (simple opacity fade-in or margin animation)
4.	The application must be responsive (your choice of breakpoint or fluid)
  a.	In respect of time, you're only required to provide support for phone portrait and desktop sizes.
5.	Build the "Reserve Vehicle" functionality
  a.	Add a button to the Vehicle List view that allows the user to reserve that vehicle.
  b.	When the user reserves a vehicle, take them to a form view where they provide:
    i.	Name (required)
    ii.	Phone (required)
    iii.	Email (required)
    iv.	Address (optional)
    v.	Notes (optional)
  c.	Each type of vehicle has it's own special modifiers for reservation that should only be visible with that vehicle type:
    i.	Cars: no special treatment
    ii.	Trucks: option to include trailer
    iii.	Boats: option to include trailer & lifejackets
6.	Reservation Form Validation
  a.	Ensure that required fields are provided, and that phone and email fields are formatted correctly.
  b.	Provide helpful feedback w/ invalid fields.
7.	Browser Support
  a.	Please support your choice of Chrome or Firefox latest.
  b.	No Safari, Internet Explorer, Opera, or other mobile browser support is required. If you do want us to test in a particular browser, let us know.
c.	Often at -----------, we use APIs and browser features that don't have ubiquitous support yet. If you use such a feature, comment your code about level of support and your strategy for legacy and future proofing.
